# Image Colorization Using Convolutional Neural Network
 
 In this notebook I will present a step-by-step approach that uses deep learning techniques for colorizing grayscale images. By utilizing a pre-train image from Kaggle, we are able to change into CIELAB color space. Then we propose a method to add color into grayscale image using model that we build using Tensorflow. As an application, we colorize the portrait of historical image and obtain interesting result, showing  the potential  of this method  in  the  growing field  of computer-assisted art.
